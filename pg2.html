                Hobbies
            </h2>

            <p>
                If we counting hobbies, I really only have two hobbies. And that's music and gaming.
                Talking about music, I have a plethora of instruments under my belt. Including:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Electric Guitar</li>
                <li>Bass Guitar</li>
                <li>Acoustic Guitar(steel string and nylon string)</li>
                <li>Drums (marching drums and drum sets)</li>
                <li>Basic knowledge in piano</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Now talking about games, I really like playing co-op games with my friends but I don't like playing games where I "grind"
                like in MineCraft. I like fast-paced games where one round of the game can just be 20 to 45 minutes of my time. 
                I play a lethora of games but I think the ones that I really visit again and again are:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Valorant</li>
                <li>Overwatch</li>
                <li>Bloons TD</li>
                <li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>
                <li>Tekken</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                I guess I also have the hobby of riding my motorcycle? But I don't really know if I can classify that as a hobby or not.
                But I do enjoy doing it recreationally. Like riding to places that I haven't to before and just enjoying the nature and scenery 
                that comes along with it.

                    Favorites
                </h2>

                <p>
                    <p>
                        I have plenty of things that can be considered my favorite. For example the color <u>black</u>. 
                        Me just using the background color black says it all right? 
                        I just think that the color is very soothing to the eyes and very fashionable to wear.
                        Like almost everything can be paired with black.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another thing that's my favorite is <u>fried food- specifically chicken.</u> The simple dish is just that good, 
                        well for me that is. I also like other food except fried ones of course. 
                        If I were to make a ranking of the top 5 food I like, It would go something like this:
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Fried Chicken</li>
                        <li>Fried Tilapia</li>
                        <li>Tinola</li>
                        <li>Pizza</li>
                        <li>Liempo</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>       
                        I think the last thing that I can say is my favorite is I guess my favorite song?
                        But to be honest, I don't have one. I guess I can give you two songs then. 
                        The song that became the catalyst ofme being a musician and
                        the song that's currently stuck on my mind right now. The said songs are, in order,
